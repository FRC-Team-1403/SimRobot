## Why Use this?


### Learning Resource

SimRobot serves as an invaluable learning resource for teams facing challenges in knowledge transfer between seasons. With simulation, team members can experiment with writing basic code for the robot, fostering continuous learning.

### Prototyping Resource

Facilitate rapid prototyping by creating a foundational prototype of subsystems and pre-coding them without the need for the actual robot. This approach accelerates the development of robot code when the physical robot is available.
